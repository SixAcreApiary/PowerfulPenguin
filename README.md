Beefy Stealthburner mount for the Klicky PCB mod.

When probing the leading edge of the 'stock' mount against the z-endstop pin the stock mount kept breaking at the screw holes.
This mount is thicker at that point as well as overall, providing much more support against flexing when probing.

And it looks like a cute little penguin, so win win!
